/*The CompletableFuture.get() method is blocking. It waits until the Future is completed and returns
the result after its completion.

We can use thenApply() method to process and transform the result of a CompletableFuture when it
arrives. It takes a Function as an argument, which means that it takes an argument of type T and
returns a result of type R.

We can also write a sequence of transformations on the CompletableFuture by attaching a series of
thenApply() callback methods. The result of one thenApply() method is passed to the next in the
series.
CompletableFuture API exposes the join() method as a way of retrieving the value of the Future object
by blocking the thread until the execution is completed. We should notice that the caller thread will
 be blocked even if the execution of the CompletableFuture is happening on a different thread
