/*A note about Executor and Thread Pool -
You might be wondering that - Well, I know that the runAsync() and supplyAsync() methods execute
their tasks in a separate thread. But, we never created a thread right?
Yes! CompletableFuture executes these tasks in a thread obtained from the global
ForkJoinPool.commonPool().
You can also create a Thread Pool and pass it to runAsync() and supplyAsync() methods to
let them execute their tasks in a thread obtained from your thread pool.
All the methods in the CompletableFuture API has two variants - One which accepts an Executor as an
argument and one which doesnâ€™t -

// Variations of runAsync() and supplyAsync() methods
static CompletableFuture<Void>	runAsync(Runnable runnable)
static CompletableFuture<Void>	runAsync(Runnable runnable, Executor executor)
static <U> CompletableFuture<U>	supplyAsync(Supplier<U> supplier)
static <U> CompletableFuture<U>	supplyAsync(Supplier<U> supplier, Executor executor)
